	Added support for immediate replication of newly created tables.
	Added support for specifying replication factor and other settings.
	Fixed bugs in support for UPDATE and DELETE prepared statements.
	Added asynchronous execution for remote updates to parallelize where there are multiple replicas.

H2O Version 0.2.4
	CREATE TABLE operation now creates new replicas in parallel.
	COMMIT operations now executed in parallel.

	VACUUM ANALYZE queries will execute ANALYZE command even though VACUUM isn't supported directly.
	Added tests for Prepared Statements and batch updates.
	Fixed error in Table Manager migration.
	In tests: removed reliance on descriptor file on a central server.
	Fixed ordering of database locations on locator server - active System Table is always first.
	System can recover from System Table failure regardless whether meta-data is held on successor, and is able
		to recover if failure occurs before the maintenance mechanisms pick it up.
	Table Manager meta-data replicated
	Table Managers recover from individual node failure failure.
H2O Version 0.2.6 (Unreleased)
	H2O can now be started by double-clicking on the JAR file.
	When a new instance is started the database URL is placed in the browser window.
	Auto-complete of tables now always chooses a new SELECT for the table that was selected, rather than appending its name.
	Fixed error where locks aren't released on tables when a SELECT query is cancelled due to incorrect syntax.
	Added the capability to create views (required ensuring correct read locks where taken out on relevant Table Managers).
	Refactored package structure
	DROP ALL OBJECTS now correctly removes table meta-data from the System Table / Table Manager.
